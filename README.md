# Elise's React Exploration

Exploration of the React framework, REST API calls, and Gen AI image generation. 

[View app here](https://elisekosm.github.io/react-side-project/)

## Overview
The app is built off of the React framework. On user input, it calls a publically available API to fetch a random cat fact. It then uses this cat fact to generate a Gen AI image from a second publically available API. The Material UI package is used for UI design. There are CI checks on the PRs to ensure code quality. The app is deployed to a GitHub page. The unit testing was done using Jest. 

## Lessons Learned
- Create and develop a React app
- Make API calls in a React app
- Use an open source Gen AI image generator
- Material UI package
- GitHub actions CI checks on a PR
- Deploy a React app to GitHub pages
- Unit testing in React using Jest

## Available Scripts
 
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app to GitHub pages.
